The package 'interval' used is a Python file interval.py which, if you use Anaconda, cannot be installed by ```conda install interval```. Install this package by 
```pip install interval```
and copy this file to ```Anaconda\Lib\site-packages```. 'peakutils' does not exist in Anaconda library; install it by ```pip install peakutils``` and copy this package to ```Anaconda\Lib\site-packages```.
